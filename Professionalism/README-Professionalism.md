## Developing & maintaining a professional online presence

Online artifacts should be professional (neutral, approachable, make a stand where it matters, welcome people to connect with you).

Focus on what is important, evidence of what you can do.

* Professional e-mail and social media accounts
  - Remembering that professional and personal accounts may become "comingled" and that people will make subjective decisions based on what they see. (Implicit bias exercise, case studies)
  - Consistancy
  - Timeless
* Portfolio accounts
  - GitHub, other web sites
    - Username
    - Bio
    - Avatars
* General principles
  - Changes break history (but may not escape bad associations)
