## What Mastery Looks Like

### Components Of Mastery

* Know the building blocks of algorithms
  - Sequences
  - Loops
  - Branches
* Know the essential characteristics of algorithms
  - Always produce a correct answer (which can include "this is not possible.")
  - Always run to completion.
* Know that the three building blocks aro sufficient to express any correct computational algoritm.
* Explain each of the three building blocks.
* Identify examples of each of the building blocks in examples of actual code.
* Develop an original algorithm to solve a computing problem.
* Express an algorithm in a flow chart.
* Express an algorithm in pseudocode.
* Express an algorithm in an executable programming language.
* Test an algorithm for correctness.
* Identify potential "corner cases."
* Describe the algorithm expressed in code written by others.
