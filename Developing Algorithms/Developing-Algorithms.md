# Developing Algorithms

## What Mastery Looks Like

### Components Of Mastery

* Define the term _algorithm_ and give examples from daily life (non-computing) and from computer science.
* Know – be able to list, explain, and give an example of – the building blocks of algorithms:
  - _Sequences_
  - _Loops_
  - _Branches_
* Know the essential characteristics of algorithms, algorithms:
  - **Always** produce a correct answer (which can include "this is not possible.")
  - **Always** run to completion.
* Know that the three building blocks are sufficient to express any correct computational algorithm.
* Know that there are problems for which there is no known algorithm for their solution.
* Identify examples of each of the building blocks in examples of actual code.
  - For example: given a block of code, mark it up to show a sequence of instructions, a branch, and a loop.
* Express an algorithm in a flow chart.
  - Given an informal description of an algorithm create a flowchart that expresses the algorithm, possibly uncovering problems in the original description of the algorithm.
* Express an algorithm in pseudocode.
  - Given an informal description of an algorithm create pseudocode that expresses the algorithm, possibly uncovering problems in the original description of the algorithm.
* Express an algorithm in an executable programming language.
  - Given a (presumably working) flowchart or the pseudocode for an algorithm, implement and test the algorithm in an executable language.
* Implement an algorithm given a problem statement
  - Given the description of a problem develop and implement, in an executable language (including developing flowcharts and/or pseudocode) an algorithm that solves the problem.
* Develop an original algorithm to solve a computing problem.
  - Independently (from the instructor) develop an algorithm to solve a problem encountered while developing a larger project.
* Test an algorithm for correctness.
  - Informally (for example seeing the expected PacDots or seeing the clock hands correctly go from noon to 1 PM and from midnight to 1 AM), and
  - More rigorously with a set of documented (or self-documenting) tests.
* Identify potential "corner cases." For example:
  - Sorting an empty list.
  - Dividing by zero.
* Describe the algorithm expressed in code written by others.
* Combine algorithms to solve a problem.
* Search for and apply a known algorithm to solve a problem.

## Related Tasks

Skills, knowledge, and behaviors that are likely to be demonstratable in the context of this task:

* Breaking a problem down into smaller problems.
* Iterating on a solution
* Reason about programs
* Communicate about programs (explain, report results of testing, read spec).
