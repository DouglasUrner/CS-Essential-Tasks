# The Essential Tasks of Computer Science

Drawing on the work of Joanne Goode and Gail Chapman in developing the [Exploring Computer Science][ecs] (ECS) curriculum and on the expression of similar ideas in the College Board AP [Computer Science Principles][csp] (CSP) curriculum.

## Core Themes

* The creative nature of computing
* Technology as a tool for solving problems
* The relevance of computer science and its impact on society

## Computing Practices

ECS identifies the essential tasks of a computer scientist – the commonality that underlies all work in CS – as:

* Analyzing the effects of developments in computing  
* Designing and implementing creative solutions and artifacts  
  From the AP CS A course description:
  - Program design & algorithm implementation
  - Code logic
  - Code implementation
  - Code testing
  - Documentation
* Applying abstractions and models  
* Analyzing their computational work and the work of others  
* Communicating computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others  
* Collaborating with peers on computing activities  

The authors of the CSP curriculum identify a similar set of "big ideas" in computer science:

1. Creativity
2. Abstraction
3. Data & Information
4. Algorithms
5. Programming
6. The Internet
7. Global Impact
